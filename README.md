# Football Results Simulator

This app allows you to simulate football results. All you need is to know the relative class of the teams involved.

## Fine-tune match parameters
Fine-tune pre-match predictions setting teams' tactics, home crowd support and even morale.

## Home and away matches
Play home and away matches in exciting 1st and 2nd leg duels! Extra time and penalties are quite possible if the score is tied after the end of two-match duel.

## Realistic match engine
The generator takes into account football statistics, so unrealistic results like San Marino beating Germany are virtually impossible.

## Morale is important
This simulator is morale-driven, so attempts and shots on goal to some extent depend on the motivation of the team.

In the future releases I will make the impact of morale even more serious.
